    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY FOR THE EVENT COUNTDOWN MOBILE APPLICATION</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date - e.g., April 11, 2025]</p>

    <h2>Preamble:</h2>

    <p>This Privacy Policy (hereinafter referred to as the "Policy") is promulgated by [Your Company/Developer Name] (hereinafter referred to as the "Licensor," "We," "Us," or "Our"), the provider of the mobile software application designated as "Event Countdown" (hereinafter referred to as the "Application"). This Policy is intended to comprehensively delineate the principles, protocols, and practices—or conspicuous lack thereof—concerning the collection, processing, storage, utilization, disclosure, and safeguarding of information pertaining to any individual (hereinafter referred to as the "User," "You," or "Your") who installs, accesses, interacts with, or otherwise utilizes the Application on any compatible mobile electronic device (hereinafter referred to as the "Device"). This document constitutes a legally binding agreement between the User and the Licensor. By installing, accessing, or utilizing the Application, You acknowledge that You have meticulously reviewed, fully comprehended, and unequivocally consented to the terms, conditions, stipulations, and provisions articulated herein. Should You dissent from or find objectionable any aspect of this Policy, Your sole recourse is to immediately cease all use of the Application and effectuate its uninstallation from Your Device.</p>

    <h2>Article I: Definitions and Interpretation</h2>

    <p>1.1.  <strong>"Application"</strong> shall refer exclusively to the "Event Countdown" mobile software application, inclusive of any and all associated features, functionalities, content, updates, patches, modifications, revisions, and supplementary materials provided by the Licensor.</p>

    <p>1.2.  <strong>"Personal Data"</strong> shall encompass any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. For the avoidance of doubt, and as exhaustively detailed infra, the Application is specifically architected and engineered to <em>not</em> solicit, collect, access, process, store, or transmit any information falling within this definition.</p>

    <p>1.3.  <strong>"Non-Personal Data"</strong> shall refer to information that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. This may include aggregated, anonymized, or statistical data. Given the functional parameters of the Application, the collection and processing of even Non-Personal Data are intentionally minimized to the absolute operational necessity, primarily existing ephemerally or solely within the confines of the User's Device operating system for standard application performance monitoring, none of which is transmitted to or accessible by the Licensor.</p>

    <p>1.4.  <strong>"User-Generated Content"</strong> shall pertain specifically and solely to the data inputted by the User directly into the Application for its core functionality, namely the title, date, and time of future events for countdown purposes, and the associated user-configured notification preferences (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Event Data").</p>

    <p>1.5.  <strong>"Processing"</strong> shall mean any operation or set of operations which is performed on data or on sets of data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</p>

    <p>1.6.  <strong>"Device"</strong> shall mean the mobile phone, tablet, or other portable electronic computing device owned or controlled by the User upon which the Application is installed and operated.</p>

    <p>1.7.  <strong>"Licensor"</strong> shall mean [Your Company/Developer Name], the entity responsible for the development, provision, and maintenance of the Application.</p>

    <p>1.8.  <strong>"Third Party"</strong> shall refer to any entity, individual, corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, association, organization, or governmental authority other than the User and the Licensor.</p>

    <p>1.9.  Interpretation: Headings and titles used herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of this Policy. The singular includes the plural and vice versa. References to statutes or regulations include any amendments, re-enactments, or replacements thereof.</p>

    <h2>Article II: Scope and Applicability</h2>

    <p>2.1.  This Policy applies solely and exclusively to the Application "Event Countdown" as provided by the Licensor. It does not extend to any other applications, websites, services, or products offered by the Licensor or any Third Party, even if accessed via links or integrations potentially present (though currently not implemented) within the Application.</p>

    <p>2.2.  This Policy governs the interaction between the User and the Application concerning data privacy. The operational paradigm of the Application is predicated on the principle of minimal data interaction and complete absence of Personal Data collection by the Licensor.</p>

    <h2>Article III: Information Collection Practices – A Statement of Non-Collection</h2>

    <h3>3.1. Explicit Non-Collection of Personal Data:</h3>
    <p>The Licensor hereby declares, unequivocally and without reservation, that the Application is designed, implemented, and operated specifically to <em>not</em> collect, solicit, access, store (on servers controlled by the Licensor), process, or transmit any Personal Data from its Users. The fundamental architecture of the Application precludes any requirement for such data.</p>

    <h3>3.2. Categories of Data NOT Collected:</h3>
    <p>To further elucidate the scope of non-collection, the Application explicitly refrains from accessing, collecting, or transmitting information including, but not limited to, the following categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a.  <strong>Identifiers:</strong> Real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol (IP) address, email address, account name, Social Security number, driver's license number, passport number, or other similar identifiers.</li>
        <li>b.  <strong>Contact Information:</strong> Telephone numbers, physical addresses, email addresses.</li>
        <li>c.  <strong>Device Information:</strong> Device identifiers (e.g., UDID, IDFA, GAID), device model, operating system version, hardware specifications, mobile network information, language settings, beyond what is standardly available to any application via the operating system APIs for basic compatibility and functionality checks, none of which is transmitted to the Licensor.</li>
        <li>d.  <strong>Location Data:</strong> Precise or coarse geolocation data derived from GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular triangulation. The Application does not request, require, or access location services.</li>
        <li>e.  <strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information regarding the User's interaction with the Application, such as features used, frequency of use, duration of sessions, crash reports (unless explicitly submitted by the user through standard operating system mechanisms independent of the Application's control), performance data, or interaction patterns. No analytics frameworks are integrated by the Licensor for tracking such data.</li>
        <li>f.  <strong>Biometric Information:</strong> Fingerprints, facial recognition data, voiceprints.</li>
        <li>g.  <strong>Financial Information:</strong> Bank account numbers, credit card or debit card numbers, or any other financial information. The Application involves no financial transactions.</li>
        <li>h.  <strong>Sensitive Personal Information:</strong> Data concerning racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.</li>
        <li>i.  <strong>Contacts/Address Book:</strong> The Application does not request permission to access, nor does it access, the User's device contacts or address book.</li>
        <li>j.  <strong>Photos/Media:</strong> The Application does not request permission to access, nor does it access, the User's photo library or other media files stored on the Device.</li>
        <li>k.  <strong>Microphone/Camera:</strong> The Application does not request permission to access, nor does it access, the Device's microphone or camera.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.3. User-Generated Content (Event Data):</h3>
    <p>The sole category of data actively managed by the Application is the User-Generated Content, specifically the Event Data (event titles, dates, times, and notification preferences) input by the User.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a.  <strong>Local Storage:</strong> This Event Data is stored exclusively and solely within the secure, local storage sandbox allocated to the Application on the User's own Device by the underlying mobile operating system (e.g., iOS, Android).</li>
        <li>b.  <strong>No Transmission:</strong> At no point is this Event Data transmitted, uploaded, synced, backed up, or otherwise made accessible to the Licensor or any Third Party via any network connection (Internet, cellular, or otherwise) initiated by the Application. The data resides entirely and perpetually on the User's Device under the User's direct control.</li>
        <li>c.  <strong>User Control:</strong> The User retains complete control over their Event Data. The User can create, view, modify, and delete Event Data at will directly within the Application's interface. Deletion of an event within the Application results in the corresponding data being removed from the local storage on the Device, subject to the standard file deletion behaviors of the operating system. Uninstalling the Application will typically result in the removal of all associated locally stored data, including all Event Data, according to the standard procedures of the mobile operating system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.4. Notification Permissions:</h3>
    <p>To provide its core reminder functionality, the Application requires the User to grant permission to display local notifications via the standard operating system prompt.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a.  <strong>Permission Request:</strong> The Application will request this permission using the standard operating system API. Granting or denying this permission is solely at the User's discretion.</li>
        <li>b.  <strong>Usage of Permission:</strong> If granted, this permission is used <em>exclusively</em> to schedule and trigger local notifications on the User's Device at the times specified by the User within the Event Data's notification preferences.</li>
        <li>c.  <strong>No Data Transmission:</strong> The act of requesting, granting, or utilizing notification permissions does not involve the transmission of any Personal Data or Event Data to the Licensor. Notification scheduling and triggering occur entirely on the User's Device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article IV: Utilization of Information – A Statement of Non-Utilization</h2>

    <h3>4.1. Purpose Limitation:</h3>
    <p>Given the fundamental principle of non-collection of Personal Data by the Licensor as articulated in Article III, it logically and necessarily follows that the Licensor does not utilize any Personal Data for any purpose whatsoever.</p>

    <h3>4.2. Non-Applicability of Common Uses:</h3>
    <p>Consequently, common data utilization purposes are entirely non-applicable to the Licensor's operation of the Application, including, but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a.  Providing, maintaining, or improving the Application (beyond utilizing non-transmitted, standard OS-level performance metrics if available).</li>
        <li>b.  Personalizing User experience.</li>
        <li>c.  Developing new features or services.</li>
        <li>d.  Analytics, performance monitoring, or usage tracking attributable to specific users.</li>
        <li>e.  Marketing, advertising (behavioral or contextual), or promotional activities.</li>
        <li>f.  Communication with the User (except potentially through App Store update notes).</li>
        <li>g.  Compliance with legal obligations requiring User data processing (as no such data is held).</li>
        <li>h.  Security monitoring related to User data (as none is transmitted or stored by the Licensor).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.3. Utilization of Event Data (Local):</h3>
    <p>The User-Generated Content (Event Data) is utilized by the Application <em>solely</em> on the User's Device for the explicit purposes for which it was entered by the User:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a.  To display the countdown timer(s) for the specified event(s).</li>
        <li>b.  To display the list of upcoming events.</li>
        <li>c.  To schedule and trigger local notifications on the Device based on the User's configured preferences for each event.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article V: Disclosure and Sharing of Information – A Statement of Non-Disclosure</h2>

    <h3>5.1. No Sharing of Personal Data:</h3>
    <p>Consistent with the non-collection principles detailed herein, the Licensor does not possess any User Personal Data associated with the Application and therefore engages in absolutely no sharing, selling, renting, leasing, licensing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise providing access to any User Personal Data to any Third Party for any reason.</p>

    <h3>5.2. No Sharing of Event Data:</h3>
    <p>The User-Generated Content (Event Data) remains exclusively on the User's Device and is never shared with or transmitted to the Licensor or any Third Party by the Application.</p>

    <h3>5.3. Non-Applicability of Sharing Scenarios:</h3>
    <p>Common scenarios involving data sharing are therefore irrelevant and non-applicable, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a.  Sharing with service providers or vendors.</li>
        <li>b.  Sharing for advertising or marketing purposes.</li>
        <li>c.  Sharing in the context of business transfers (mergers, acquisitions, etc.), as there is no User-specific data asset associated with the Application held by the Licensor.</li>
        <li>d.  Sharing for legal compliance, law enforcement requests, or protection of rights, as the Licensor holds no relevant User data to share.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article VI: Data Security</h2>

    <h3>6.1. Focus on Local Data:</h3>
    <p>The security considerations for the Application primarily relate to the protection of the User-Generated Content (Event Data) stored locally on the User's Device.</p>

    <h3>6.2. Reliance on Operating System Security:</h3>
    <p>The Application stores Event Data within the standard, sandboxed local storage mechanisms provided and secured by the mobile operating system (e.g., iOS, Android). The security of this locally stored data is therefore contingent upon the inherent security features of the User's Device and its operating system, including device passcodes, biometric authentication, encryption-at-rest (if enabled by the OS), and general operating system integrity.</p>

    <h3>6.3. No Transmission Security Concerns:</h3>
    <p>As the Application does not transmit Personal Data or Event Data over any network, security measures related to data-in-transit (e.g., TLS/SSL encryption) are not applicable to the Application's direct operation.</p>

    <h3>6.4. User Responsibility:</h3>
    <p>The User acknowledges responsibility for maintaining the physical security of their Device and utilizing the security features provided by the operating system (e.g., strong passcodes, keeping the OS updated) to protect all data stored locally, including the Event Data within the Application.</p>

    <h3>6.5. Licensor's Limited Scope:</h3>
    <p>The Licensor implements reasonable standard software development practices aimed at preventing unintentional vulnerabilities within the Application code itself that could compromise the local data storage sandbox. However, the Licensor makes no warranty regarding the absolute security of data stored locally, given its dependence on the Device and operating system security posture, which are outside the Licensor's control.</p>

    <h2>Article VII: Data Retention</h2>

    <h3>7.1. Local Retention:</h3>
    <p>User-Generated Content (Event Data) is retained locally on the User's Device for as long as the User keeps the corresponding event within the Application or for as long as the Application remains installed on the Device.</p>

    <h3>7.2. User-Controlled Deletion:</h3>
    <p>Users can delete individual events at any time, which removes the corresponding Event Data from local storage. Uninstalling the Application typically removes all associated data.</p>

    <h3>7.3. No Licensor Retention:</h3>
    <p>The Licensor retains absolutely no Personal Data or User-Generated Content related to the User's use of the Application.</p>

    <h2>Article VIII: Children's Privacy</h2>

    <h3>8.1. Age Limitation:</h3>
    <p>The Application is not directed towards, nor intended for use by, individuals under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age threshold stipulated in the User's jurisdiction).</p>

    <h3>8.2. Non-Collection from Children:</h3>
    <p>The Licensor does not knowingly collect any Personal Data from children under 13 (or the relevant age threshold). As the Application is designed not to collect <em>any</em> Personal Data from <em>any</em> User, this policy inherently extends to children.</p>

    <h3>8.3. Parental Guidance:</h3>
    <p>If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided information to the Application (which, by design, should be impossible in terms of Personal Data transmission to the Licensor), or has concerns about the locally stored Event Data, they should instruct the child to delete the relevant data within the Application or uninstall the Application entirely. Should there be any residual concerns, the parent or guardian may contact the Licensor via the details provided in Article XI.</p>

    <h2>Article IX: User Rights and Control</h2>

    <h3>9.1. Rights Regarding Personal Data:</h3>
    <p>Standard data protection rights such as the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing of, or port Personal Data, often mandated by regulations like the GDPR or CCPA, are fundamentally predicated on the data controller (in this case, the Licensor) holding or processing such data. As the Licensor does not collect or hold any Personal Data through the Application, these specific rights, while acknowledged in principle, are practically non-exercisable in relation to the Licensor concerning this Application, as there is no data upon which to act.</p>

    <h3>9.2. Control Over Event Data:</h3>
    <p>The User maintains complete and direct control over their User-Generated Content (Event Data) stored locally on their Device through the Application's interface. This includes the ability to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a.  <strong>Access:</strong> View the Event Data within the Application.</li>
        <li>b.  <strong>Rectify:</strong> Modify or edit existing Event Data.</li>
        <li>c.  <strong>Erase:</strong> Delete specific Event Data or uninstall the Application to remove all associated data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>9.3. Control Over Notification Permissions:</h3>
    <p>The User can manage the Application's permission to send local notifications at any time through the standard settings interface of their Device's operating system.</p>

    <h2>Article X: Amendments to this Privacy Policy</h2>

    <h3>10.1. Right to Amend:</h3>
    <p>The Licensor reserves the unilateral right to modify, amend, update, or revise this Policy at any time and for any reason, at its sole discretion.</p>

    <h3>10.2. Notification:</h3>
    <p>Notification of substantial changes may be provided through mechanisms deemed appropriate by the Licensor, which might include, but are not limited to, posting the revised Policy within the Application, on an associated website, or via App Store update notes.</p>

    <h3>10.3. Effective Date:</h3>
    <p>The "Effective Date" at the beginning of this Policy indicates the date of the latest revision. Users are encouraged to periodically review this Policy to stay informed about our data practices (or lack thereof).</p>

    <h3>10.4. Acceptance of Amendments:</h3>
    <p>Continued use of the Application following the posting or notification of any amendments to this Policy shall constitute the User's unqualified acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, such revised terms. If the User objects to any changes, their sole recourse is to cease using the Application and uninstall it.</p>

    <h2>Article XI: Contact Information and Governing Law</h2>

    <h3>11.1. Contact:</h3>
    <p>Should You have any inquiries, concerns, ambiguities, or require clarification regarding this Privacy Policy or the privacy-related aspects (or non-aspects) of the Application, You may endeavor to contact the Licensor through the following means:<br>
    [Insert Your Contact Email Address or Method Here - e.g., Email: privacy@yourdomain.com]</p>

    <h3>11.2. Response Clarification:</h3>
    <p>Please be advised that response times may vary and that inquiries related to exercising data rights concerning Personal Data held by the Licensor will likely receive a response clarifying the non-collection of such data by this Application.</p>

    <h3>11.3. Governing Law:</h3>
    <p>This Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Insert Your Jurisdiction - e.g., the State of California, USA], without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising under or in connection with this Policy shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts located in [Insert Your Jurisdiction - e.g., Santa Clara County, California].</p>

    <h2>Article XII: Miscellaneous Provisions</h2>

    <h3>12.1. Severability:</h3>
    <p>If any provision, clause, term, or stipulation of this Policy is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void, or unenforceable, such finding shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions, clauses, terms, or stipulations, which shall continue in full force and effect.</p>

    <h3>12.2. Entire Agreement:</h3>
    <p>This Policy constitutes the entire agreement between the User and the Licensor with respect to the subject matter hereof (privacy and data practices related to the Application) and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter.</p>

    <h3>12.3. Waiver:</h3>
    <p>No waiver by the Licensor of any term or condition set forth in this Policy shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the Licensor to assert a right or provision under this Policy shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

    <h3>12.4. Language:</h3>
    <p>This Policy is written in the English language. To the extent any translated version of this Policy conflicts with the English version, the English version shall prevail and control.</p>

    <h2>Acceptance:</h2>

    <p>BY INSTALLING, ACCESSING, OR UTILIZING THE EVENT COUNTDOWN APPLICATION, YOU AFFIRM THAT YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT, OR HAVE OBTAINED PARENTAL OR GUARDIAN CONSENT TO DO SO, AND THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
